This also includes traffic rules. However, in certain cases, officers are allowed to break traffic laws to be able to respond to calls. The following list shall explain the prio\u2019s used by the Dutch Police, their meaning and their usage. It will also state whether traffic laws may be broken, and at what time: \u25cf Prio 3 \u25cb This is used for low-priority calls, such as requests to go to a specific location, or for non- emergency calls. It is not allowed to use emergency signals while driving at prio 3. This also means the traffic laws are not allowed to be broken. \u25cf Prio 2 \u25cb This is used for medium-priority calls where there is no direct threat to life, such as reports of a car theft or a dispute between two civilians. Emergency signals aren\u2019t used unless necessary, such as when approaching a busy intersection. It is permitted to break traffic laws where necessary, such as going over the speed limit or driving against the flow of traffic. When causing situations that might cause harm to others, it is advised to use your emergency lights. \u25cf Prio 1 \u25cb The highest priority, used when there is a threat to life, such as a shooting, a report about an injured person, or a panic call from a fellow officer. These calls require the highest priority, and it is permitted to use emergency signals. It is permitted to break traffic laws, although it must always be done carefully as not to cause harm to any bystanders. Weapon regulations Any police officer is given access to an X26 Taser, a baton and a Walther P99QNL pistol. Since these are considered (less than-) lethal weapons, there are specific regulations regarding their usage. Using any of these weapons on a fellow peace or safety officer is not permitted and will be punished as abuse of powers and breaking the rules of engagement. Taser The X26 taser is a weapon that fires two darts at the target, shocking the target and rendering them immobile. This weapon is best used at a short to medium range. In the Antilles, this weapon shall be used to either: \u25cf Stop a fleeing suspect; \u25cf Take down an armed suspect at short range, if there is little to no threat to life. Baton Every police officer is equipped with an extendable baton. In the Antilles, this weapon shall be used to: \u25cf Warn civilians who refuse to listen to orders, by just equipping the weapon \u25cf Push away civilians who do not follow orders given https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ir-qejrQbqU37Bv2PXEKUe8Hc2w27LiGZys-b3kJ0g/mobilebasic 7/14 2/8/26, 3:43 PM Korps Nationale Politie | Handbook 2025 Although this weapon is considered less than lethal, it does harm the suspect, and it should be used with care so as not to kill the suspect. Walther P99QNL This weapon is the standard-issue firearm for the Dutch National Police. It is a 10/15-round, 9mm pistol. This weapon can be used as a deadly weapon. Therefore it is only to be used in the following situations: \u25cf When your own life is in danger \u25cb Situations such as knife attacks or shootings \u25cf When the life of others are in danger \u25cf As a method of threatening a suspect \u25cb For example approaching a possibly armed suspect \u25cb Warning shots Failure to follow this regulation will be considered use of excessive force and failure to follow the rules of engagement and will be punished accordingly. Other weapons The regulations regarding weapon usage for other units, such as the protection unit and arrest team are stated in their own manuals or guidelines. The usage of any other weapons, such as the ones sold by gun dealers, is forbidden and punishments can be given for using and/or possessing these weapons while on duty. Radio Regulations The most important tool of an officer is their radio. It is their main form of communicating with other officers, and other departments. Usage of the radio is crucial in many situations, and the usage is strictly enforced. The following guidelines explain the correct usage of the radio. Starting patrol Upon joining the National Police team, the officer will send the following message in the radio: \u201c(/e) Signing on.\u201d This message states that the officer is on duty, and available for any calls. When working as a specific unit, it is preferred to add \u201cAs UNIT NAME\u201d, for example when they join the Protection Unit team, the officer will state that they are signing on as Protection Unit. This is to make sure officers are aware what units are available at that moment. Traffic stops and pursuits If an officer sees a person driving dangerously or speeding, the officer shall send a message in the radio stating the location of the car, model and colour, and the offence committed. This way other officers can more easily intervene when something goes wrong, or when another unit has to take over a traffic stop. Once the suspect has been stopped, the traffic stop is announced in the radio using the following format: \u201cTS - Car model and color - Location - Additional units required / not required\u201d If any additional units are requested, the officer who is either: \u25cf Closer to the officer conducting the traffic stop; \u25cf The first to respond that they are en route will respond to the call, and shall help out the officer. Once the traffic stop is over, the officer shall report this on the radio. In case a pursuit starts, the officer shall report the pursuit by sending the following message in the radio: \u201cPur(suit) - Car model and color - Location\u201d While driving, the officer is required to give updates on the location. This way other officers who have not https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ir-qejrQbqU37Bv2PXEKUe8Hc2w27LiGZys-b3kJ0g/mobilebasic 8/14 2/8/26, 3:43 PM Korps Nationale Politie | Handbook 2025 yet joined the pursuit can more easily join, or block the suspect\u2019s path. Shootings In case a suspect pulls a gun out, or starts shooting, the first thing an officer must do is press the panic button. This way, other officers know there is a life-threatening situation. All available officers are to respond to the emergency call, prio 1. If an officer is conducting a traffic stop at the moment, they are to end the stop as quickly as possible, as to help out the officer in distress. Once all suspects are down, and there is an ambulance available, the officers are to report the situation to the Ambulance service, and tell them whether it is safe to come or not. Checkpoints Checkpoints may only be hosted by an officer qualified with OvD-P with the rank of \u201csergeant\u201d or above. Checkpoints are commonly used to check the validation of someone\u2019s citizenship and/or check for illegal items. During a checkpoint there needs to be at least one cone and one stop sign to mark it as a checkpoint. There has to be a marked area where vehicles are being parked during the check. There are at least two law enforcement officers needed to make the traffic check work. The checkpoint may only be done once every 24 hours, and it is not allowed to have it within 100 studs from a gun or bomb dealer. During a checkpoint you may ask for identification and search everyone under the Search Act of 2023. When searching a person, the officer is required to state the reason for the search. The highest ranking officer present during the checkpoint is required to log the checkpoint within the MoJS Discord immediately after finishing. The log needs to contain the following information: 1. the location of the check; 2. the start time of the check; 3. the end time of the check; 4. who gave permissions for the check Rank responsibilities \u25cf First Chief Commissioner \u25cb As the highest ranking member of the department, they oversee the department and make sure the day-to-day operations run smoothly. This rank may: \u25a0 Give any form of punishment \u25a0 Promote officers \u25a0 Handle reports \u25a0 Use OVD-P \u25cf Chief Commissioner \u25cb This rank serves as the heads of each regional unit. They are responsible for the day-to- day operations of their units, and supervise the Chief Inspectors that are under their command. Together they work with the First Chief Commissioner to maintain the department\u2019s high standards.
