accordance with the same requirements for imminent lethal threat and proportionality

<pre class="preblock">e.  During authorized training or educational exercises. 
f.  Merely holding a weapon without imminent threat does not justify lethal force. (e.g.

<p>and prepared to use a weapon against others.</p>
