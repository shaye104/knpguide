<p>Driving regulations</p>
<pre class="preblock">All officers are required to follow the Dutch law and constitution. This also includes traffic rules. However, in
certain cases, officers are allowed to break traffic laws to be able to respond to calls. The following list shall
explain the prio’s used by the Dutch Police, their meaning and their usage. It will also state whether traffic
laws may be broken, and at what time:</pre>
<p>● Prio 3</p>
<pre class="preblock">○ This is used for low-priority calls, such as requests to go to a specific location, or for non-
emergency calls. It is not allowed to use emergency signals while driving at prio 3. This also
means the traffic laws are not allowed to be broken.</pre>
<p>● Prio 2</p>
<pre class="preblock">○ This is used for medium-priority calls where there is no direct threat to life, such as reports
of a car theft or a dispute between two civilians. Emergency signals aren’t used unless
necessary, such as when approaching a busy intersection. It is permitted to break traffic
laws where necessary, such as going over the speed limit or driving against the flow of
traffic. When causing situations that might cause harm to others, it is advised to use your
emergency lights.</pre>
<p>● Prio 1</p>
<pre class="preblock">○ The highest priority, used when there is a threat to life, such as a shooting, a report about
an injured person, or a panic call from a fellow officer. These calls require the highest
priority, and it is permitted to use emergency signals. It is permitted to break traffic laws,
although it must always be done carefully as not to cause harm to any bystanders.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">Weapon regulations
Any police officer is given access to an X26 Taser, a baton and a Walther P99QNL pistol. Since these are
considered (less than-) lethal weapons, there are specific regulations regarding their usage. Using any of
these weapons on a fellow peace or safety officer is not permitted and will be punished as abuse of powers
and breaking the rules of engagement.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">Taser
The X26 taser is a weapon that fires two darts at the target, shocking the target and rendering them
immobile. This weapon is best used at a short to medium range. In the Antilles, this weapon shall be used
to either:</pre>
<p>● Stop a fleeing suspect; ● Take down an armed suspect at short range, if there is little to no threat to life.</p>
<p>Baton Every police officer is equipped with an extendable baton. In the Antilles, this weapon shall be used to:</p>
<p>● Warn civilians who refuse to listen to orders, by just equipping the weapon ● Push away civilians who do not follow orders given</p>

<h2 id="2-8-26-3-43-pm">2/8/26, 3:43 PM</h2>
<p>Korps Nationale Politie | Handbook 2025</p>
<p>Although this weapon is considered less than lethal, it does harm the suspect, and it should be used with care so as not to kill the suspect.</p>
<pre class="preblock">Walther P99QNL
This weapon is the standard-issue firearm for the Dutch National Police. It is a 10/15-round, 9mm pistol.
This weapon can be used as a deadly weapon. Therefore it is only to be used in the following situations:</pre>
<p>● When your own life is in danger</p>
<p>○ Situations such as knife attacks or shootings</p>
<p>● When the life of others are in danger ● As a method of threatening a suspect</p>
<p>○ For example approaching a possibly armed suspect ○ Warning shots</p>
<p>Failure to follow this regulation will be considered use of excessive force and failure to follow the rules of engagement and will be punished accordingly.</p>
<pre class="preblock">Other weapons
The regulations regarding weapon usage for other units, such as the protection unit and arrest team are
stated in their own manuals or guidelines. The usage of any other weapons, such as the ones sold by gun
dealers, is forbidden and punishments can be given for using and/or possessing these weapons while on
duty.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">Radio Regulations
The most important tool of an officer is their radio. It is their main form of communicating with other officers,
and other departments. Usage of the radio is crucial in many situations, and the usage is strictly enforced.
The following guidelines explain the correct usage of the radio.</pre>
<p>Starting patrol</p>
<pre class="preblock">Upon joining the National Police team, the officer will send the following message in the radio:
“(/e) Signing on.”
This message states that the officer is on duty, and available for any calls.
When working as a specific unit, it is preferred to add “As UNIT NAME”, for example when they join the
Protection Unit team, the officer will state that they are signing on as Protection Unit. This is to make sure
officers are aware what units are available at that moment.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">Traffic stops and pursuits
If an officer sees a person driving dangerously or speeding, the officer shall send a message in the radio
stating the location of the car, model and colour, and the offence committed. This way other officers can
more easily intervene when something goes wrong, or when another unit has to take over a traffic stop.
Once the suspect has been stopped, the traffic stop is announced in the radio using the following format:</pre>
<p>“TS - Car model and color - Location - Additional units required / not required”</p>
<p>If any additional units are requested, the officer who is either:</p>
<p>● Closer to the officer conducting the traffic stop; ● The first to respond that they are en route</p>
<p>will respond to the call, and shall help out the officer.</p>
<p>Once the traffic stop is over, the officer shall report this on the radio.</p>
<p>In case a pursuit starts, the officer shall report the pursuit by sending the following message in the radio: “Pur(suit) - Car model and color - Location”</p>
<p>While driving, the officer is required to give updates on the location. This way other officers who have not</p>

<p>Korps Nationale Politie | Handbook 2025</p>
<p>yet joined the pursuit can more easily join, or block the suspect’s path.</p>
<pre class="preblock">Shootings
In case a suspect pulls a gun out, or starts shooting, the first thing an officer must do is press the panic
button. This way, other officers know there is a life-threatening situation. All available officers are to
respond to the emergency call, prio 1. If an officer is conducting a traffic stop at the moment, they are to
end the stop as quickly as possible, as to help out the officer in distress.
Once all suspects are down, and there is an ambulance available, the officers are to report the situation to
the Ambulance service, and tell them whether it is safe to come or not.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">Checkpoints
Checkpoints may only be hosted by an officer qualified with OvD-P with the rank of “sergeant” or above.
Checkpoints are commonly used to check the validation of someone’s citizenship and/or check for illegal
items. During a checkpoint there needs to be at least one cone and one stop sign to mark it as a
checkpoint. There has to be a marked area where vehicles are being parked during the check. There are at
least two law enforcement officers needed to make the traffic check work. The checkpoint may only be
done once every 24 hours, and it is not allowed to have it within 100 studs from a gun or bomb dealer.
During a checkpoint you may ask for identification and search everyone under the Search Act of 2023.
When searching a person, the officer is required to state the reason for the search.</pre>
<p>The highest ranking officer present during the checkpoint is required to log the checkpoint within the MoJS Discord immediately after finishing. The log needs to contain the following information:</p>
<pre class="preblock">1. the location of the check;
2. the start time of the check;
3. the end time of the check;

<p>Terminations, punishments and appeals</p>
<pre class="preblock">A member of the “Corps Leadership” or member of the “Internal Affairs” (formerly “Safety, Integrity and
Complaints”) team may terminate members of the Korps Nationale Politie for multiple reasons as found
under the standard regulations. Termination of an officer must meet the following requirements:</pre>
<p>● A majority of the Internal Affairs team must have voted for the termination of this officer; ● The termination is in accordance with the standard regulations and the law;</p>
<p>○ Exceptions can be made for exceptional situations.</p>
<pre class="preblock">A member of the team “Internal Affairs” (formerly “Safety, Integrity and Complaints”) is allowed to issue a
strike, warning, Zero Tolerance Policy or any other punishment that is necessary for the officer&#x27;s action. A
member of the “Corps Leadership” is always allowed to overrule this decision.</pre>
<p>Warnings are split into two categories - verbal and official:</p>
<pre class="preblock">● Verbal warnings are recorded punishments, but don&#x27;t go onto the officers disciplinary record. This
type of punishment is used for the least severe instances of rule breaking;
● Official warnings go directly onto the officers disciplinary record. This type of punishment is used
for less severe instances of rule breaking;</pre>
<p>○ An officer may not have more than three official warnings on their record. Reaching three official warnings ends in a 7 day suspension;</p>
<p>■ With the limit reached, any future punishment that would normally be an official warning is automatically upgraded to a strike.</p>
<p>Strikes are recorded punishments that go onto the officers disciplinary record. This type of punishment is used for severe cases of rule breaking.</p>
<p>● Reaching three strikes equals an immediate termination.</p>
<pre class="preblock">Suspensions are recorded punishments that go onto the officers disciplinary record. This type of
punishment is used for very severe cases of rule breaking. A suspension may last no shorter than 1 day
and no longer than 2 weeks, with an exception of a court order.</pre>
<pre class="preblock">PT’s are recorded punishments that don’t go onto the officers disciplinary record. PT’s can be given out for
most cases of rule breaking. PT’s can be given out in-game by officers ranked Sergeant or above. The kind
of the PT is up to the officer giving it out. A PT can be anything between simple Jumping Jacks (JJ’s) and
swimming between islands.
ZTP (Zero Tolerance Policy) is a punishment that goes onto the officer&#x27;s disciplinary record. This type of
punishment is used for very severe cases of rule-breaking, or when an officer has previously committed
multiple offences (regardless of severity), and there has been no improvement in conduct. Any offence that
is committed during the term of the ZTP will result in an immediate termination rather than a normal
punishment. A ZTP cannot last indefinitely and must always have a specified duration.</pre>
<p>Any officer may appeal their punishments. The reviewers of this appeal are members of the appeal team. Officers may submit their appeal if they meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>● The appeal must be opened within 5 days of the given punishment;</p>
<pre class="preblock">○ If the appeal isn’t opened within that time frame, or if the appeal is declined, the respective
punishment may not be appealed for the next 1 / 4 months (1 month for warnings, 4 months
for strikes and other punishments);</pre>
<p>■ One can only appeal a termination within 5 days of them receiving the notice; ■ Verbal warnings cannot be appealed;</p>
<p>● The officer should have counter-proof against the reason for his punishment.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth process of resignation, an officer must open a ticket in the HRM server. If not done, the leave will be considered a “dishonorable discharge” leading to a blacklist of 1 month.</p>
